    <h1 class="mb-8 !mt-0">Hello there, I'm Jason ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an aspiring software engineer and soon to be a student at the <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Singapore Management University</a> from 2026/2027 to pursue my Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) degree after completing my National Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I hold a diploma in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics from <a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg/student" target="_blank">Nanyang Polytechnic</a>, the knowledge I gained from my diploma has helped me understand the importance of security in software development. My tenure at <a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg/student" target="_blank">Nanyang Polytechnic</a> has instilled in me a passion for developing software with security in mind, by writing secure code and following best security practices such as the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10</a> during my development process.

    <p>
        Fun fact! I did not start with a programming background and only began learning programming in my first year of polytechnic. I started with Python for my school projects, which I really struggled with in the first few months of learning how to code. Afterwards, I moved on to C++ for competitive programming on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Dratornic" target="_blank">Codeforces</a>, which I did for fun. I then learnt Go for personal projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/KJHJason/Cultured-Downloader" target="_blank">Cultured Downloader</a>. Afterwards, during my internship at <a href="https://www.stoneforest.com.sg/" target="_blank">RSM StoneForest</a>, I learnt C# for web development and then moved on to learning Rust, which I used for this website! What is my next language going to be? I wonder!
    </p>

    <p>
        Other than software development, I enjoy learning Japanese, watching anime or reading manga, and playing video games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank">Phasmophobia</a>. Moreover, I enjoy listening to <a href="https://porterrobinson.com/" target="_blank">Porter Robinson</a>'s works, like his "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurture_(album)" target="_blank">Nurture</a>" album. It really drives me to improve myself as a person and to really enjoy the little things in life.
