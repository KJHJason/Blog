    <h1 class="mb-8 text-2xl font-medium tracking-tighter">Hello there, I'm Jason ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an aspiring software engineer and soon to be a student at the Singapore Management University to get my Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) degree after my National Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I hold a diploma in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics from Nanyang Polytechnic, the knowledge I gained from my diploma has helped me understand the importance of security in software development. I hope to combine my knowledge in both fields to create secure and efficient software. 
    </p>
